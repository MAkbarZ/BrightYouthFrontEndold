  The double entry system of recording introduces two terms to identify dual
  impacts in every transaction, i.e. Debit and Credit.
</p>

<h2 class="by-article-heading">Debit</h2>

<p class="by-article-para">
  Debit means the aspect of the transactions in which a business receives any
  benefit.
</p>

<h2 class="by-article-heading">Credit</h2>

<p class="by-article-para">
  Credit means the aspect of the transactions in which a business receives any
  loss.

  A business’ internal purpose is to acquire and maintain maximum amount of
  “Economic Resources” such as assets which prolongs life of the business. These
  resources are crucial and when the business receives or uses them, the
  accountant of the business considers that event “a benefit” and records as
  Debit.
</p>

<p class="by-article-para">
  On the other hand, the accountant considers those events which threatens the
  business’ resources from being used.

<p class="by-article-para">
  Now, we simply replace Benefit with “Debit” and Loss with “Credit” words as
  below.

        The business records as benefit when an asset (for example, land,
        building, cash, or claim on someone or another business) is received,
        otherwise, it is not in the benefit of business that its’ assets have
        been decreased.

      <td>
        The business records as loss when owner’s claim over the asset of the
        business increases. <br /><br />

        This means that at any time in the future, owner(s) might close the
        business, or at least, resize-down the business by withdrawing money or
        money equivalent from the business.

      <td class="by-text-center by-border-all">Debit</td>
      <td>
        Like owner’s equity, the business also records a loss when liability has
        increased. This means that claim of lender has been established or
        increased over the asset of the business. If liability has been
        decreased, by paying off to the lender, the business records as benefit.

        Students always confuse over a concept of why the business records
        Income (or Sales) as a loss. <br />

          <li class="by-list-item">

              Cash or Receivable increases. (Debited)
            </span>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <br />
        For simplicity, in the beginning of accounting studies, point 1 and 2
        above are combined and just referred to a single term as “Sales”.

    <tr class="by-border-bottom">
      <td class="by-text-bright by-text-center"><b>Expenses</b></td>

        The business always enjoys if its resources are increased, more building
        area, machine hours, labor hours, experts’ hours, insurances, bank
        services, stationaries, equipment, etc. <br /><br />
        While students confuse here that expenses are bad, but it is not.
        Expenses are resources which is benefit for the business. “Paying for
        those Expenses” lead to decrease in Cash or Asset, which is loss.
        <br /><br />
        More resources you put in the business, more performances arise in
        generation of revenues through best product and services. As resources
        are scarce, it is expenses, and business must pay more and more to
        acquire sufficient resources.
        <br /><br />
        One other aspect of Expenses is that it reduces Owner’s Equity, that’s
        why, students think of it as “Loss”.
